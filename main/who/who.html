    <h3>Carlos &rarr; President</h3>
    Originally from Guayaquil, Ecuador, Carlos began smoking cigarettes at the age of 17. With concerns for his health and being around for his children Carlos began vaping in June of       2013. Disgusted with the current offerings on the market and the high prices for "good juice" Carlos began to set the blue prints for 7 Crimes in June 2014.

    <h3>Justin &rarr; Marketing & R&D</h3>
A Charleston, SC native. Justin began smoking at the age of 15. Just like Carlos Justin decided to try vaping in March of 2014 along with James after a long discussion about life, kids, death, etc etc over some fine craft beers. 3 hours and only D.D. Peckers knows how many beers, Justin and James risked their lives to run across Savannah Highway during rush hour traffic in West Ashley to a local vape shop to check it out and never looked back.

    <h3>James &rarr; Chef</h3>
A San Diego, California native and Charleston, SC transplant. James began smoking at the age of 20 in a attempt to be "cool" and impress a girl he worked with. James attempted vaping in June 2010 with a overpriced cigalike setup but the attempt failed miserably due to technology of the time. James finally fell into vaping after running across Savannah Highway with Justin and damn near having a heart attack. James became a chef of sorts after working in a vape shop and realizing that the current local offerings absolutely "sucked ass".
